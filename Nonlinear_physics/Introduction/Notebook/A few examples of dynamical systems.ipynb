    "The aim of this notebook, in association with the first lecture of the dynamical system class I teach at Arts et Métiers, is to illustrate some of the various concepts that will be taught during the course on a set of relatively simple, yet illustrative, examples.\n",
    "For that purpose, the following systems will be considered:\n",
    "- `Double pendulum`: canonical example from classical physics belonging to the class of *Hamiltonian systems*, i.e. systems for which a quantity (namely the Hamiltonian, here the sum of the potential and kinetic energies) is conserved.\n",
    "- `Lorenz system`: canonical example from dynamical system theory belonging to the class of *dissipative systems* of particular historical importance.\n",
    "- `Logistic map`: Another classical example from dynamical system theory used to illustrate the concept of bifurcations. Note that, contrary to all other examples considered herein, this one is formulated in a discrete-time framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided you have installed `julia` and the required packages (i.e. `Plots.jl`, `PyPlot.jl`, `DifferentialEquations.jl` and `DynamicalSystems.jl`), this notebook should be self-contained.\n",
    "All of the pieces of code needed to run the various examples are included.\n",
    "If you encounter any problem when running this notebook, please do not hesitate to get back to me either by email ([&#128231;](jean-christophe.loiseau@ensam.eu)) or directly on GitHub and I'll try to fix it.\n",
